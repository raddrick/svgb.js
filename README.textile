h1. svgb

h3. A boilerplate for your svg and backbone objects

__svgb__ bring's SVG together with Backbone.js, Underscore.js, jQuery/JS and HTML5 driving the clientside.  __svgb__ attempts to lay the ground work for an SVG driven games, advertisment, and other RIA web application. 

*NOTE*
This is a work in progress..I am still deciding how I want this to work.


h2. Description

The current state of this project is crude.

So far this is how to set the frame and stage up to have your svg injected into it:

bc.. <script type="text/javascript">
  jQuery(function(){
    var svgb_collection = new SVGBStages(
      [{
        name:'main', 
        transform:'translate(0,0)', 
        options: ''
      }]);
    var svgb_model = new SVGBFrame({
        id:'0',
        height:'500',
        width:'500',
        viewbox:'0 0 200 200',
        options:''
      });
    var svgb_view = new SVGBFrameView({ 
        collection:svgb_collection,
        model:svgb_model
      });
    var svgb_ctrl_cursor_pos = new SVGBControl({
        name:'mouse_coords',
        x:0,
        y:0
      });
    $("#container").append(svgb_view.render().el);
  })
</script>

p. 

Templates are defined as such:

bc.. <script type="text/template" id="svgb-path">
  <path d="<@= d @>" <@= options @>/>
</script>

p. Using <==@== ==@==> and <==@=== ==@==> for client side interpolation

h3. Coming down the pipe:

* Controls
* I/O events
* Dropping a Point
* Drawing a line between Points
* Using a control to build a Dialog
* Backbone models: shape, point, transform
* Rails models: frame, stage, template
