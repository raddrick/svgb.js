h1. svgb

h3. A boilerplate for building svg interfaces

__svgb__ attempts to facilitate using SVG for ui controls and other graphcal interfaces.


h2. Description

The current state of this project is crude.

So far this is how to set the frame and stage up to have your svg injected into it:

bc.. <div id="frame"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  
  var el = document.getElementById('frame');

  var model = new svgb.models.Frame({height:200,width:300});
  var view = new svgb.views.Frame({el: el, model: model});

  view.render();

  var r = new svgb.models.Rect({x:10, y:10, height:100, width:100});

  view.model.append(r);
  view.render();

</script>
